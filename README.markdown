# Toggle AirPort.scpt #

Toggle AirPort.scpt is a simple AppleScript file that will either enable or disable your AirPort connection. It is best used with a program that lets you assign global hotkeys for running scripts, like Quicksilver, so you can toggle your wireless connection with a simple keystroke.

## Installation and Use ##

Copy `Toggle AirPort.scpt` to your computer.
	
Run the script. It's that easy.

If you are using Quicksilver, place it in a directory that is indexed. Set up a new trigger to run the script.

If [Growl](http://growl.info/ "Growl") is installed, you'll get a popup notification. 

Toggle AirPort.scpt works on OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and above. It should work with 10.5 (Leopard) as well, but is currently untested.
