# Toggle AirPort.scpt #

`Toggle AirPort.scpt` is a simple AppleScript file that will either enable or disable your AirPort connection. It is best used with a program that lets you assign global hotkeys for running scripts, like Quicksilver, so you can toggle your wireless connection with a simple keystroke.

## Installation and Use ##

Copy `Toggle AirPort.scpt` to your computer.
	
Run the script. It's that easy.

If you are using Quicksilver, place it in a directory that is indexed. Set up a new trigger to run the script.

If [Growl](http://growl.info/ "Growl") is installed, you'll get a popup notification. 

Because OS X 10.7 (Lion) renamed "Airport" to "Wi-Fi", the original version of `Toggle Airport.scpt` doesn't work. Version 2, released on July 25, 2011, does though, and is completely compatible with Lion. Version 1 is still available at Github for OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) users.
